# Upraised Quiz Web App

## Overview
This web application evaluates users on various skill sets through a series of quiz questions. Built using React and Material-UI, it features a timer for each question, score calculation, and a results display.

## Features
- Interactive quiz interface
- Timer for each question with dynamic scoring
- Results summary including correct and incorrect answers
- User-friendly design with responsive layout

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React, Material-UI
- **State Management:** Context API
- **Routing:** React Router
- **Deployment:** [Vercel](link-to-your-deployment) or [Netlify](link-to-your-deployment)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- npm or yarn

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ``` or ```bash
   yarn install
### Running the Application
1. To start the development server, run:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ``` or ```bash
   yarn start
2. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
### API Endpoints
While this app currently doesn't utilize a custom backend, it retrieves quiz questions from the Open Trivia Database API. Hereâ€™s the structure:

GET /api/questions: Fetch a set of quiz questions from the Open Trivia Database.
### REST Guidelines
Use appropriate HTTP methods: GET for fetching data; POST for submitting results (future implementation).
URL patterns should be meaningful (e.g., /api/questions).
Return appropriate HTTP status codes: 200 OK for successful requests; 400 Bad Request for invalid inputs; 500 Internal Server Error for server issues.
### Deployment
Deploy the application using Vercel or Netlify. Follow their documentation to connect your GitHub repository and deplo
y the app.
### Code Structure
src/: Contains all React components and context providers.
components/: Contains individual components such as QuizCard and ResultComponent.
context/: Contains the QuizContext for state management.
App.js: Main application file that manages routing.
### Best Practices
Code Organization: Structure files logically; use meaningful names.
Component Design: Keep components small and focused; reuse where possible.
State Management: Use Context API for global state; keep local state within components.
API Integration: Use async/await for API calls; handle errors gracefully.
Responsive Design: Ensure usability across devices; test on different screen sizes.
Performance Optimization: Use memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders; lazy load components.
Accessibility: Use semantic HTML; ensure color contrast; add ARIA roles where needed.
Testing: Write unit and integration tests with Jest and React Testing Library.
Documentation: Provide clear code comments and maintain a detailed README.md.
Version Control: Use Git with regular commits and descriptive messages.
Security: Validate inputs; use HTTPS; store sensitive data securely.
CI/CD: Implement automated testing and deployment processes with CI/CD tools.
### Code Documentation
Inline comments have been added to clarify the purpose of functions and important logic, such as state management in QuizCard and ResultComponent.
